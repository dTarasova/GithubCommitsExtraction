# GithubCommitsExtraction
This program takes the address of a repository with Python code on GitHub, takes the selected number of last commits (50 by default) and saves the code changes in them to csv file. 

The program also displays statistics for these commits: 
1) a list of authors sorted by the number of commits
2) the author of the largest and smallest in terms of the number of changed commit lines
3) a list of files sorted by how often they changed.

In the program you should insert your username and password from github, name of repository that will be analyzed, number of commits and path to save changes in the code.
